**About the Project**

The Web3 Chat System is a decentralized, blockchain-powered messaging platform designed for secure, censorship-resistant communication. It enables users to chat peer-to-peer (P2P) without relying on centralized servers, ensuring privacy, transparency, and ownership of messages. By leveraging smart contracts and Web3 authentication (MetaMask, ENS, or DIDs), the system ensures trustless interactions, making it ideal for education, DAOs, and Web3-native communities.


**Vision of the Project**

The Web3 Chat System aims to redefine communication in education and Web3 communities by enabling secure, censorship-resistant, and decentralized interactions. Our vision is to create a trustless, tokenized ecosystem where students, educators, and organizations can collaborate without centralized control. By integrating EDU Chain, we empower knowledge-sharing, transparent learning, and incentivized engagement, making education more accessible, private, and rewarding.
